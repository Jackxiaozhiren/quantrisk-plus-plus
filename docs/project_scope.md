# QuantRisk++ — Project Scope (Phase 0, frozen v0.1)

Date: 2026-09-25 · Status: **SPEC ONLY — nothing is implemented.**
This document answers the Phase 0 Gate: scope complete, math spec exists (see
`mathematical_specification.md`), validation protocol exists
(see `validation_protocol.md`), architecture diagram exists (see `architecture.md`),
and no unimplemented functionality is claimed.

## 1. Motivation

Graduate programs in Financial Engineering / Financial Mathematics / Quantitative
Finance / Applied Mathematics / Statistics / Data Science admit applicants who can
work **with** mathematical models — not just call ML libraries. QuantRisk++ is built
to demonstrate exactly that: a small, reproducible C++/Python engine where every
number is traceable to a definition, an implementation, a test, and a benchmark.

Anti-goal stated upfront: this is not a stock-prediction dashboard, not a trading
bot, and not an LLM wrapper. There are no return guarantees and no trading
recommendations anywhere in this project.

## 2. Central research question

> Can a compact, reproducible C++/Python quantitative risk engine reproduce
> analytical financial results, provide statistically valid risk estimates, and
> expose transparent numerical behavior across pricing, simulation, portfolio risk
> and stress testing?

Sub-questions (one per build phase; each must be answered with evidence, not prose):

1. (Phase 2) Does our Black-Scholes + CRR binomial code reproduce closed forms,
   put-call parity, and QuantLib within stated tolerances?
2. (Phase 3) Does our Monte Carlo engine exhibit the theoretical `O(1/√N)` error
   decay, correct 95% CI coverage, and measured variance reduction?
3. (Phase 4) Can we price path-dependent payoffs and simulate Heston dynamics with
   documented discretization bias and positivity behavior?
4. (Phase 5) Are VaR/ES estimators + Kupiec/Christoffersen backtests statistically
   valid on synthetic distributions before touching real data?
5. (Phase 6) Does our optimizer satisfy constraints, agree with PyPortfolioOpt/cvxpy
   on identical inputs, and degrade gracefully on singular covariance?
6. (Phase 7) Does every stress scenario map to explicit assumptions →
   reproducible transformation → portfolio impact → attribution?
7. (Phase 8–10) Is the whole pipeline reproducible offline with frozen evidence
   (SHA256 manifest) behind every number in the README?

## 3. Intended users

- The applicant (graduate-school portfolio + interview defense).
- Admissions reviewers / professors (3-minute README → validation matrix → report).
- Open-source peers who want a clean, small reference implementation with honest
  limitations (students, RSEs, quants).

## 4. Non-goals (explicit)

- No live trading, order execution, or portfolio advice.
- No price forecasting / alpha signals / "AI stock picker".
- No Web App / dashboard as the core value (a minimal CLI/demo only, Phase 9).
- No paid data, paid APIs, paid cloud, or proprietary solvers ($0 constraint).
- No unsupported models: everything without an oracle gets a written
  "validation weaker than …" disclaimer (Heston is the known case).
- No vanity metrics: any benchmark/speedup/coverage number must come from a
  script → raw result → artifact chain (see `validation_protocol.md`).

## 5. Architecture (summary; detail in `architecture.md`)

```text
Python research layer (orchestration, experiments, plotting, CLI)
        │  pybind11 bindings (thin, no numerics reimplemented)
        ▼
C++20 numerical core (pricing, MC/GBM/Heston, risk, portfolio, stress)
        │  Eigen (linalg) · Catch2/CTest (tests) · CMake (build)
        ▼
Validation oracles (QuantLib, PyPortfolioOpt/cvxpy, SciPy — reference only)
Experiments + evidence/ (CSV/JSON/plots + SHA256 manifest)
Optional data layer (SEC/FRED/CFTC, cached, offline fixtures for CI)
```

Layer rules (frozen):
1. Numerics live in C++20; Python orchestrates and analyzes.
2. Bindings are thin — no second implementation of the same formula.
3. Core never touches the network; data is optional and cached.
4. Every claim needs an artifact; artifacts are hashed in Phase 10.

## 6. Validation philosophy (summary; detail in `validation_protocol.md`)

Three levels, applied per component:

- **Level 1 — Analytical oracle:** closed form / parity / limiting behavior
  (e.g. BS formula, put-call parity, σ→0 / T→0 edges).
- **Level 2 — Independent open-source oracle:** live QuantLib / PyPortfolioOpt /
  cvxpy / SciPy comparison with recorded versions and tolerances.
- **Level 3 — Statistical convergence:** MC `O(1/√N)` slope fit, CI coverage,
  bootstrap uncertainty, backtest distributions.

Plus deterministic policy: `std::mt19937_64`, no global RNG state, recorded seeds,
`double` core precision, recorded compiler/OS/CPU/commit metadata, absolute +
relative tolerances chosen per test family (not tuned to force passes).

## 7. Cost constraint ($0 + AI tokens)

Allowed: local compute, GitHub + Actions free tier, SEC EDGAR, FRED/ALFRED free
API (env-var key, fixture fallback), CFTC public data, synthetic data, QuantLib,
Eigen, pybind11, Catch2, NumPy/SciPy, pandas/Polars, matplotlib, statsmodels,
scikit-learn, cvxpy + open-source solvers, PyPortfolioOpt. Anything requiring
payment gets replaced by a free alternative — never recommended to the user.

## 8. Phase map (from PROJECT_SPEC.md, abbreviated)

Phase 0 (this doc set) → 1 engineering skeleton → 2 BS/binomial/Greeks →
3 Monte Carlo → 4 path-dependent/Heston → 5 VaR/ES/backtesting →
6 portfolio optimization → 7 stress testing → 8 public data →
9 Python API/CLI → 10 validation matrix + frozen evidence + report + release.

Rule: one phase at a time; each phase ends with a Phase Report and stops.

## 9. Current status (honest, 2026-09-26)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `docs/project_scope.md` (this file) | DONE (Phase 0) |
| `docs/ecosystem_research.md` | DONE (Phase 0) |
| `docs/mathematical_specification.md` v0.1 | DONE (Phase 0, spec only) |
| `docs/validation_protocol.md` | DONE (Phase 0) |
| `docs/architecture.md` (+ diagram) | DONE (Phase 0) |
| Phase 1 build/packaging/C++ core/bindings/tests/CI | DONE (see `docs/phase_reports/phase-01-engineering-foundation.md`) |
| Pricing, simulation, risk, optimization, stress, data layers | NOT IMPLEMENTED — no such numbers exist yet |

## 10. Frozen Phase 1 surface

- `namespace quantrisk`, `Real = double`, `Time/Rate/Volatility/Money/Count/Seed`.
- `Rng` (instance-owned `std::mt19937_64`, explicit seed, no global state).
- `normal_pdf`, `normal_cdf`, `inverse_normal_cdf`, `stats::*`, `version()`,
  `build_metadata()`, `ValidationError`.
- Python smoke surface: `quantrisk.version()`, `quantrisk.normal_cdf(0.0)`.

Eigen enters with Phase 6 (first real dense linear algebra), not Phase 1.
